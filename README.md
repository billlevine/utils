# Introduction

This is the start of a collection of small utility scripts, packaged as flox
packages.  They are either too complex for aliases, or to create adhoc within
the flox environment... or just too fun to make into flox packages and use that
way.

`flox install billlevine/purge-storepath`

## purge-storepath
Utility to purge a storepath from your store.  Does so by deleteing
referrers before trying to delete the storepath itself.
